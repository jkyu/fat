compute-dihedrals.py is heavily commented, so details can be found there. It goes through each raw trajectory and places the evolution of the dihedral angles on a uniform time grid.
The data is saved in ./data/dihedrals-avg.pickle

figure S6 plots the average evolution of the dihedral angles alpha, beta and gamma over
all thirty AIMS simulations. 
The figure is generated by plot-dihedrals.py from data collected in compute-dihedrals.py
The population-weighted average over all ICs is then computed with error bars from bootstrapping and plotted here for figure S6. 

./data/dihedrals-avg.pickle is also used to track the dihedral angles during times of population transfer for figure S5.
