compute-blas.py places the BLA coordinate on a uniform grid for each TBF
and averages them over all ICs.
The data is saved to the ./data/bla.pickle file

plot-bla.py takes this data from bla.pickle and makes the figure for
figureS4. This is the early time average of the BLA mode over all 
AIMS simulations to show the BLA relaxation early in the excited
state dynamics.
