collect-energies.py just interpolates the absolute energies onto a grid.
These energies aren't very meaningful by themselves -- what matters is the relative energies,
which you should compute at your discretion.
The plot script included here is just to see that this works. 
It won't go into a paper or a slide like the population plot.
