Prototype for computing absorption spectra. 
compute_absorption.py calls dump_energies.sh, which does the parsing of the
electronic structure outputs. 
Lorentzian broadening is then used to compute the absorption spectrum
from each of the single point calculations.

Required: point the compute_absorption.py script to the directory where
all of the single point calculations are performed. 


plot_ab_fl.py plots the steady state fluorescence and absorption simultaneously
and compares to experimental results. 
This uses data from the fluorescence calculations that can be done in ../fluorescence
