Run scripts in this order:
1. compute-populations.py to get the data that will generate the population decay plot with bootstrapped error bars.
2. compute-fit-error.py to get an error on the exponential fit. 
3. plot-populations.py

plot-singles.py is optional, but maybe useful if you want a closer look at the population dynamics. 
It follows the population change of a single state for uncoupled AIMS simulations separately and averaged (thick line)
